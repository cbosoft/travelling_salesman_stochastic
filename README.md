# Travelling Salesperson: stochastic solver

The travelling salesperson problem is to find the optimal route through a list
of destinations, including a return to home.

This project, as part of an office "code golf" match, is to use stochastic
methods to solve the problem. I have implemented this solution in C++ as part
of my effort to brush up on the language.
